Chain of Responsibilies Design Pattern

- The Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers.
- Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.


Request Processing: Each handler either:
    -   Processes the request if it can handle it
    -   Passes it to the next handler if it can't
    -   Returns "End of chain" if there are no more handlers
