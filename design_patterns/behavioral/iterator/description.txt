Iterator Design Pattern

- The Iterator pattern provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.


Key benefits:

Simplifies collection traversal
Encapsulates iteration logic
Enables different iteration strategies
Supports multiple concurrent iterations

Real-world examples:

File system traversal
Paginated database queries
Processing streaming data
