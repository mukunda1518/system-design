Memento Design Pattern


Memento Pattern (a.k.a. Snapshot Pattern) is a Behavioral design pattern, and it’s used to save and restore previous state of an object.
If you want to develop an application, that has undo or rollback functionality, you should go with Memento Design Pattern.
Most of the software developers use this pattern whenever they want to develop such functionality within their application

The Memento Design Pattern has 3 components know as, Originator, Caretaker, and Memento.

Originator: The object that we need to maintain the state. Basically, the Originator object creates a memento object to store its internal state. As a result, the Originator object knows how to save and restore itself.

Caretaker: The object that keeps the track about Originator. Basically, Caretaker knows why and when the Originator needs to save and restore itself.

Memento: The object that contains basic state storage and retrieval capabilities. Usually, the Memento object is immutable and pass it’s the data only once, through the constructor.
