Strategy Design Pattern

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable


Problems it solves:

When you need different variants of an algorithm and want to switch between them dynamically
When you have similar classes that only differ in their behavior
When you want to isolate the algorithm logic from the code that uses the algorithm
