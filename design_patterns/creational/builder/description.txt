Builder
- Helps to constructs the complex objects
- The Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
- This is useful when constructing objects that require a lot of step-by-step configurations.

Use
- Use the Builder pattern to get rid of a “telescoping constructor”.
- Use the Builder pattern when you want your code to be able to create different representations of some product (for example, stone and wooden houses).
    - The base builder interface defines all possible construction steps, and concrete builders implement these steps to construct particular representations of the product. 
    - Meanwhile, the director class guides the order of construction.

How to implement:

- Make sure that you can clearly define the common construction steps for building all available product representations. Otherwise, you won’t be able to proceed with implementing the pattern.

- Declare these steps in the base builder interface.

- Create a concrete builder class for each of the product representations and implement their construction steps.

- Think about creating a director class. It may encapsulate various ways to construct a product using the same builder object.

- The client code creates both the builder and the director objects. Before construction starts, the client must pass a builder object to the director. Usually, the client does this only once, via parameters of the director’s class constructor. The director uses the builder object in all further construction. There’s an alternative approach, where the builder is passed to a specific product construction method of the director.

- The construction result can be obtained directly from the director only if all products follow the same interface. Otherwise, the client should fetch the result from the builder.
