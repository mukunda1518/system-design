Factory Pattern
- The Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides a way to create objects without
 specifying their exact class in the code


Usage:
- When you have multiple related classes and want to centralize object creation logic.
- This is useful when the exact type of object that needs to be created depends on certain conditions.


Purpose
- Encapsulates the object creation logic
- Decouples the client code from specific implementations.
