------------------------------- Snake and Ladder -------------------------

- Multi Player Game
- Size of the board should be dynamic (m * n)
- Posible to use more than 1 dice
- No of snakes and ladders should be variable based on the level of the game
- No loop for snakes and ladders
- System should decide the game has ended



------------ Snake and Ladder Game Analysis -----------

##################### Actors

Primary Actors:

Human Player: Interacts directly with the game, makes moves
Computer Player: AI-controlled player that follows game rules


Secondary Actors:

Game System: Manages game rules, board state, and flow
Board: Maintains positions and game elements



##################### Functional Requirements

Game Setup

Configure board size (m x n)
Add multiple players (human/computer)
Set number of dice
Place snakes and ladders dynamically
Validate snake and ladder positions


Game Play

Roll multiple dice
Move players based on dice value
Handle snake encounters (move down)
Handle ladder encounters (move up)
Track player positions
Determine winning condition


Game State Management

Track game progress
Record number of moves
Identify winning player
Display game state and results



##################### Non-Functional Requirements

Performance

Efficient board state management
Quick move validation
Optimal memory usage for large boards


Scalability

Support variable board sizes
Handle multiple players efficiently
Accommodate different numbers of snakes and ladders


Maintainability

Clear code organization
Well-documented classes and methods
Modular design for easy updates


Reliability

Validate all moves and positions
Prevent invalid game states
Handle edge cases gracefully



##################### Design Patterns Used

Factory Method Pattern

Used in creating snakes and ladders
Game class acts as creator for game elements


Strategy Pattern

Different player types (Human/Computer) implement same interface
Allows for different dice rolling strategies


Singleton Pattern (potential)

Could be applied to Game class for single game instance
Manage global game state


Observer Pattern (potential)

Could be implemented for notifying players of game events
Track game state changes



#####################  SOLID Principles Applied

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each class has a single purpose
Board manages board state
Game manages game flow
Snake/Ladder handle their specific behaviors


Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Player interface allows adding new player types
Game elements can be extended without modifying existing code


Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

HumanPlayer and ComputerPlayer can be used interchangeably
All players follow IPlayer interface contract


Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

IPlayer interface contains only essential methods
No unnecessary dependencies between components


Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules (Game) depend on abstractions (IPlayer)
Low-level modules (HumanPlayer, ComputerPlayer) implement interfaces
